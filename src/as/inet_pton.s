    // Arguments:
    // x0: address family (AF_INET)
    // x1: IP address string
    // x2: pointer to struct in_addr (to store the result)

    // Here you would implement the function to convert the IP address
    // string to a binary representation, which is quite involved.
    // For simplicity, we will assume the address is "127.0.0.1".

    mov x0, #1 // Success
